#### Abstract
Rapid progress in radio technology has culminated in the production of something like
a smart system classified as Cognitive Radio (CR). This form of radio harnesses popular
Artificial Intelligence tactics to create an outstanding dynamic behaviour. The cognitive
radio network (CRN) is regarded to be amongst the potential ways to tackle the
challenge of spectrum shortage and optimal use of spectrum. Within a CRN the
Secondary User (SU) is permitted to own the spectrum that the Primary User (PU) is
currently not utilising. The CRN is a wireless communication network of the next era
that enables SUs to own the underused or unoccupied spectrum, defined as white spaces,
in authorized spectrum with minimized interference to PUs. This thesis contributes a
method that implements cognitive radio using a machine learning technique, that is, an
incremental neural network combined with reinforcement learning. By this method we
could achieve efficient utilization of spectrum without any interference to PUs.
